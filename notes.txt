Run this command: npm run dev
Open localhost:3000
To close it: Ctrl + C

The app/api folder hold backend api endpoints (like the one that we need for authentication)

prisma is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). Basically, how my app talks to the database

Bringing project to another computer instructions
