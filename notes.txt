Hello monkey.

TO run this project and see it created, make sure you are in C:\Users\liaml\My Drive\Planner\my-app in the terminal.
Run this command: npm run dev
Open localhost:3000
To close it: Ctrl + C

The app/api folder hold backend api endpoints (like the one that we need for authentication)

Frameworks used
next.js is my application framework.
prisma is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). Basically, how my app talks to the database

Company Services
neon - cloud service for hosting my postgresSQL database

When cloning the github repo
-> bring in .env
-> bring in .env.local
-> run npm install (builds the native modules )
-> npx prisma generate


npx prisma migrate dev
-> run this command when you edit the schema.prisma. This command detects the differences to that file and applies it to the database
